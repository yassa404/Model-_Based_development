## Introduction to Model-Based Development
Model-Based Development (MBD) revolves around using abstract models to represent and analyze systems. These models guide the design, testing, and implementation stages. The methodology enhances system analysis and ensures a smoother development process by focusing on simulations and models from the very start.
