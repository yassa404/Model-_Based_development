# Model-Based Development Repository

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to my studies and projects related to Model-Based Development (MBD). Model-Based Development is an approach to system development where models serve as the primary artifacts throughout the development process. This README provides an overview of the contents of the repository and guidance on how to navigate through the different components.

## Introduction to Model-Based Development
Model-Based Development (MBD) is a methodology that uses models as the core artifacts in the development process. It involves creating abstract representations of a system and using these models for analysis, design, and implementation. This section provides a brief introduction to MBD and its benefits.

## MATLAB
**Folder Link**: [MATLAB Projects](https://github.com/yassa404/Model-_Based_development/tree/main/MATLAB)

This section contains fundamental learning resources about MATLAB, including loops, functions, and matrices. It also includes the final project, which is the simulation of a simple pendulum.

### Projects:
- **Project: Simple Pendulum**  
  [Link to Project](https://github.com/yassa404/Model-_Based_development/tree/main/MATLAB/Project)  
  Objective: Simulating the motion of a simple pendulum using MATLAB.

## Simulink
**Folder Link**: [Simulink Projects](https://github.com/yassa404/Model-_Based_development/tree/main/Simulink)

This section includes various basic Simulink projects such as function calls, look-up tables, switch-case examples, and a mass-spring-damper system simulation.

### Projects:
- **Project: Mass-Spring-Damper System**  
  [Link to Project](https://github.com/yassa404/Model-_Based_development/tree/main/Simulink/Laps/mass_spring_dumper)  
  Objective: Analyzing the dynamics of a mass-spring-damper system.

## Interface Simulink Arduino
**Folder Link**: [Simulink-Arduino Interface Projects](https://github.com/yassa404/Model-_Based_development/tree/main/Arduino%20Simulink%20Interface)

This section contains projects that demonstrate interfacing Simulink with Arduino, primarily for controlling motors and lights. One of the highlighted projects is a signal light control system for vehicle direction indicators.

### Projects:
- **Project: Direction DC Motor Control**  
  Objective: Control the direction of a DC motor using Simulink and Arduino.  
  Project Files:  
  - `direction_dcmotor_3 control`  
  - `control_on_left_right_off_byenableblook_4`  
  - `control_on_left_right_off_byenableblook_by_press_5`

- **Project: Signal Light Control System**  
  Objective: Simulate a vehicle signal light system using Arduino and Simulink.  
  Detailed behavior includes handling indicators for right, left, and hazard lights, with automatic switching.

## PID Controller
**Folder Link**: [PID Controller Projects](https://github.com/yassa404/Model-_Based_development/tree/main/PID_controler/laps)

This section focuses on various PID control projects, including first- and second-order systems, and tuning of PID controllers. A significant project in this section involves the control of a solar panel using a PID controller.

### Projects:
- **Project: Solar Panel Control with PID**  
  [Link to Project](https://github.com/yassa404/Model-_Based_development/tree/main/PID%20controller%20projects/project1)  
  Objective: Control the orientation of a solar panel using a PID controller to optimize solar energy capture.

### Lab Examples:
- **Lab: First-Order System Control**  
  Objective: Understand and apply the concepts of first-order system control using Simulink.
- **Lab: PID Controller Tuning**  
  Objective: Tune a PID controller for a second-order system using S-shape methods.
