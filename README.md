# Model-Based Development Repository

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to my studies and projects related to Model-Based Development (MBD). Model-Based Development is an approach to system development where models serve as the primary artifacts throughout the development process. This README provides an overview of the contents of the repository and guidance on how to navigate through the different components.

## Introduction to Model-Based Development
Model-Based Development (MBD) is a methodology that uses models as the core artifacts in the development process. It involves creating abstract representations of a system and using these models for analysis, design, and implementation. This section provides a brief introduction to MBD and its benefits.
