# Model-Based Development Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my studies and projects related to Model-Based Development (MBD). MBD is a system development methodology that uses models as the central artifacts throughout the development lifecycle. This README provides an overview of the repository’s structure, highlighting various projects and concepts.

## Introduction to Model-Based Development
Model-Based Development (MBD) revolves around using abstract models to represent and analyze systems. These models guide the design, testing, and implementation stages. The methodology enhances system analysis and ensures a smoother development process by focusing on simulations and models from the very start.

## Projects

### MATLAB
This folder contains fundamental learning materials for MATLAB, including loops, functions, matrices, and other basic concepts. Additionally, there’s a final project that showcases a simple pendulum simulation.

- **Basic Concepts**: Covers the core MATLAB skills necessary for beginners.
- **Final Project**: [Simple Pendulum Simulation](https://github.com/yassa404/Model-_Based_development/tree/main/MATLAB/Project)
